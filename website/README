This document assumes that your working directory is the root of the website. It also assuming that you're running this on the AdWhirl AMI.

If you didn't come here from setting up the server, you should take a look at ~/adwhirl/server/README first.

I have marked areas in the website code that you will need to change with "CHANGEME". 

At a minimum, you will need to change:
   AWS keys for SimpleDB
   AWS keys for S3
   S3 bucket name(s)

You can easily find these using grep.
`grep -r "CHANGEME" *`

You will need to allow access to the temporary images folder if it isn't already configured.
`chmod 777 imagestemp`

If you wish to use the charting functionality of the website, you will need to download FusionCharts (http://www.fusioncharts.com/), and copy the .swf files into the FusionCharts directory. They can no\
t be included in the source code of this project due to license restrictions.

NOTE: For some reason I don't understand yet, a symlink in /var/www/html isn't working, so I bound the source directory instead.

So go to http://your-domain:8080/adwhirl/, and you should see your very own hosted configuration website!

Cheers!
